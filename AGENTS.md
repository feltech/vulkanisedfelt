# vulkanisedfelt — Agent Orientation

## Environment

A Nix flake dev env is available in build_env and ensures all tools are installed. In an interactive
shell, the dev env is activated automatically via `direnv`.

Detect if you're working in a dev shell by checking the existence of `IN_NIX_SHELL` environment
variable.

If not in the dev shell, then prefix all commands below with `nix develop ./build_env --command `;
or use `direnv`, either by making the project directory the cwd, or by running
`direnv exec . <command>`

Seek explicit permission from the user before editing `build_env/flake.nix`.

Some non-standard command line tools are available in PATH that may be helpful:

- JSON parser `jq` - always use first for JSON.
- html parser `pup`.
- YAML, INI processor `yq`.
- XML processor `xq`.
- GitHub CLI `gh` (avoid `gh api` unless there is no alternative).
- Image manipulation `imagemagick`.

You have permission to use these tools in bash (and several others), but require approval before you
can use scripts in Python or bash/shell. Use targeted tools before resorting to the Bash tool with
Python or shell scripts to avoid awaiting approval.

In particular, use the Write or Edit tools before using the Bash tool with Python, `cat` or shell
scripts, including when writing to `/tmp/opencode`.

Strongly prefer the read/write/edit tools over bash tool. Avoid patterns like
`cat > some_file.txt << 'EOF'` - use the write tool instead.

Use the read and grep tools before resorting to reading and parsing files with a Python script.

NEVER do `find /` nor `find /nix/store` - it will take an intractable amount of time.

When probing/testing and need a compiler, use `g++`, `cmake`, etc available in `PATH` - do not use
absolute paths to the tool. Write probe test executables under `/tmp/opencode`, where you have write
and execute permissions.

Make use of subagents for targeted tasks, reducing context fill with useless intermediate steps.

## Build and test

The full build and test cycle is (not all steps required depending what was edited)

```bash
conan install . --build=missing -s "&:build_type=Debug" \
  -pr:a build_env/nixos.linux.conan.profile
cmake --preset conan-debug -Dvulkanisedfelt_ENABLE_DEV=ON
cmake --build --parallel --preset conan-debug
ctest --test-dir build/Debug --output-on-failure --parallel --timeout 300
```

## Linting, formatting, and testing

`clang-format`, `cpplint`, `cmake-lint`, `cmake-format`, `doxygen` and `mdformat` linters are
integrated into the build when `vulkanisedfelt_ENABLE_DEV=ON` such that the build fails on linter
warning. DEV mode also enables the embedded doctests.

fnfelt is pinned in `vendor/fnfelt` as a Git submodule. After cloning, run
`git submodule update --init --recursive`. Its CMake project resolves pinned stdexec through CPM;
the root Conan recipe supplies Immer and libfork. fnfelt's own development checks stay disabled
unless explicitly enabled separately.

`clang-tidy` is currently **disabled** (see the TODO in `cmake/linters.cmake`) because it does not
support C++26 reflection, so none of its checks gate the build. In particular, the naming rules
below are not machine-enforced for now: apply them by hand, and keep `.clang-tidy` and the Naming
section in sync.

Only suppress linter issues as a last resort.

Each linter is available on PATH.

Commit messages follow the Conventional Commit rules in `.gitlint`. Install the local commit hook
with `gitlint install-hook` to check messages automatically.

Testing uses C++ doctest - very similar to Catch2 syntax.

### Auto-format

If formatting is required

- CMake files: `cmake-format -i CMakeLists.txt` - where `CMakeLists.txt` is the file to format.
- C++ files: `clang-format -i main.cpp` - where `main.cpp` is the file to format.
- Markdown files: `mdformat README.md` - where `README.md` is the file to format.

### Copyright header

All files that can support inline comments should have a copyright header

```shell
# vulkanisedfelt
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
# Copyright 2026 David Feltell
```

Where `#` is the comment prefix for the file type.

### Docstrings

Docstrings for C++ use javadoc style with no @brief necessary (JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF=YES).

All C++ headers should start with an `@file` doxygen description after the copyright

```c++
/**
 * @file public_header.hpp
 *
 * Short description.
 *
 * Longer description if useful.
 */
```

Keep docstrings concise. Do not explain implementation details. Focus on why and what rather than
how.

Avoid listing members in file header docstrings.

Avoid mentioning outside callers in function and class docstrings.

We want to keep commits focused on the area they cover: editing the docstring of an otherwise
unmodified function pollutes the commit and makes rewriting git history (rebases) more difficult.

Documentation on how a function works and technical challenges and solutions should be provided by
inline comments and not in docstrings.

Place a blank line between heading, description, and parameters in class/function docstrings, e.g.

```c++
/**
 * Brief title.
 *
 * Short description.
 *
 * @tparam T Template parameter.
 * @param P Function parameter.
 * @return Return value.
 */
```

### Header order

Headers should be ordered as follows:

- Associated header (if applicable)
- Standard library headers
- Third-party library headers
- Project public headers (`<>` surround, when present)
- Project private headers (`""` surround)

Use paths relative to the including file for project private headers, including associated headers.
Use a `./` prefix for headers in the same directory to distinguish them from global includes. Do not
use paths rooted at the project directory, such as `src/vulkan/errors.hpp`; use `"./errors.hpp"`,
`"../errors.hpp"`, or `"vulkan/errors.hpp"` as appropriate for the including file.

With a space in-between each section, e.g.

```c++
#include "./feature.hpp"

#include <optional>
#include <string>

#include <fnfelt/monad/io.hpp>
#include <libfork>

#include "./private.hpp"
```

cpplint will partially enforce header order but can get confused, e.g. not recognizing `<meta>`. To
fix, place the header in its own section, e.g.

```c++
#include <meta>

#include <optional>
#include <string>
```

## Naming

std-aligned. `.clang-tidy` is the authoritative source; the rules below mirror it. `clang-tidy` is
currently disabled (C++26 reflection), so apply these rules by hand - do not rely on a diagnostic.
When `.clang-tidy` changes, update this section in the same commit.

Boolean variables should use qualifiers such as `is_`, `has_`, `should_`, e.g. `is_offending_set`.

Avoid names that clash with an existing name. For example, avoid variable name `io`, if it clashes
with namespace `io` - use a more descriptive name instead.

### Casing

These are the casings configured in `.clang-tidy` (`readability-identifier-naming`).

- Namespaces and inline namespaces: `lower_case`.
- Classes, structs, unions, abstract classes, and enums: `CamelCase`. This includes trait and
  dispatch structs and data types (e.g. `Unspecialise`, `Sequence`, `IO`).
- Concepts: `lower_case` (e.g. `rebindable`, `applicable_with`).
- Type aliases (`using`) and `typedef`s: `lower_case`. Disambiguate when necessary by adding a
  `_type` suffix, e.g. `action_type`, `value_type`. Namespace-scope computed `::type` aliases take a
  `_t` suffix (e.g. `rebind_t`); member aliases take no `_t` (e.g.
  `Unspecialise<C>::specialise<TArgs...>`, `type`).
- Enum constants, scoped or unscoped: `lower_case`.
- Functions and methods: `lower_case`.
- Variables, constants, `constexpr` variables, non-static data members and parameters: `lower_case`.
- Type template parameters (including template-template parameters): `CamelCase` prefixed `T` (e.g.
  `TContainer`, `TArgs`); a lone `T` is allowed. The prefix distinguishes template parameters from
  types and aliases, and avoids shadowing when a member alias renames the parameter (e.g.
  `template <class TArg> struct A { using Arg = TArg; };`).
- Value (non-type) template parameters: `lower_case` (e.g. `idx`, `target_meta`, `error_preamble`).
  These are values rather than types, so they follow the functions-and-values convention.
- Macros: `UPPER_CASE` (ALL_CAPS constants emitted by macros are allowed).

### Identifier length

`readability-identifier-length` requires variables and parameters to be at least 3 characters, with
`fn` exempted. Loop counters must be at least 2 characters, but the conventional one-letter counters
`i`, `j` and `k` are exempt; caught exception variables must be at least 2, but `e` is exempt.

### Semantic conventions

clang-tidy cannot express these; follow them by hand.

- Concepts: no prefix/suffix. Capabilities of one type take `-able` (e.g. `rebindable`); predicates
  over multiple arguments take a trailing preposition (e.g. `applicable_with`, `specialisation_of`);
  abstractions are nouns (e.g. `transformer`).

- Functors: `CamelCase` struct (e.g. `Construct`, `Sequence`) with a `lower_case` `inline constexpr`
  instance where a value form helps (e.g. `construct`). Use at most one call-facing form per verb.

- Monadic factories: prefix functions returning IO, ReaderIO or StateIO with `io_`, `reader_io_` or
  `state_io_`, respectively. Plain calculations keep ordinary operation names. Stored action
  callables retain `IOAction`/`ReaderIOAction`/`StateIOAction` suffixes; continuations retain the
  corresponding `Continuation` suffix.

### Test files

Doctest encourages placing tests in the program's translation units, which are disabled by defining
`DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE` for production. Place embedded tests at the end of the corresponding `.cpp`
file.

Every doctest test-case name must contain exactly one category tag:

- `[pure]`: policy and data transformations without API effects.
- `[impure]`: effectful actions and orchestration exercised through mocked APIs.
- `[integration]`: smoke and regression coverage using real APIs.

Every `[integration]` test must also contain exactly one environment tag: `[headless]` for tests
that need no window or display, or `[windowed]` for tests that require them. Headless Vulkan tests
still require a working Vulkan implementation. For example,
`TEST_CASE("[integration][headless] creates and destroys an instance")`.

Run all tests for now. Tags allow manual filtering, for example
`--test-case-exclude="*[integration]*"`. A future CMake configuration variable may make CTest
exclude integration tests; do not add that plumbing until requested. Pure and mocked impure tests
may link Vulkan and SDL; they must not call the real APIs.

This project builds the `vulkandemo` executable. Translation units under `src/` contain production
code and embedded doctests. The application target is defined in `src/CMakeLists.txt`; the root
CMake file owns options and dependency setup. fnfelt is a header-only dependency under
`vendor/fnfelt`; its development checks and tests stay disabled in this consumer build.

Wrap test-only code for files in `src/` in `#ifndef DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE` and
`#endif // DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE`, including headers that are only used for tests.

Keep related implementation and private headers together under `src/`. As the migration grows, place
reusable public headers under `include/vulkanisedfelt/` and mirror that hierarchy in `src/`. Keep
Vulkan actions small and compose them with fnfelt; the `monads` branch in this repo (vulkanisedfelt)
is a reference rather than a second framework to revive.

When adding compile-fail tests (code that must NOT compile), place them under `tests/compile_fail/`
and drive them with CMake. Use a subdirectory per source file, with test cases as files under that
subdirectory. Use corresponding `.` delimiter in CMake test names.

Compile-time validation structures should be injected into types so that the validator function can
be tested without compilation failure, and so only a single compile_fail test is needed using a stub
validator. Compile-fail tests are expensive and serialized: test individual error conditions with
direct validator assertions.

## Coding conventions

Use C++26 reflection extensively for compile-time logic, in particular for type validation with
clear human-readable error messages.

Reflection documentation starting point: https://cppreference.com/cpp/meta/reflection

Load the `cpp26-reflection` skill (`.agents/skills/cpp26-reflection/SKILL.md`) before writing
reflection code. It records verified gcc 16.2 behaviour, API signatures, and gotchas, so there is no
need to scan the gcc source tree or write probe executables for what it covers.

Read the online documentation in preference to performing live probes of the compiler.

If live probes are still required, report what information was missing back to the user so that the
skill can be updated.

C++ `concept`s should be used for overload resolution and as boolean utilities. Avoid using concepts
purely to constrain a type or function (the errors are difficult to read) - use reflection instead.

Use ADL (argument-dependent lookup) where possible, for cleaner code, e.g.

```c++
bool check_complete(std::meta::info info)
{
  return is_complete_type(action_meta);  // not std::meta::is_complete_type
}
```

Maintain a FILE_SET in CMake when introducing a target with public headers.

Practice IWYU (Include What You Use) - fine-grained `#include`s, avoiding transitive includes. A
rare exception is if an umbrella header is explicitly part of the design (i.e. where leaf headers
contain `// IWYU pragma: private, include`).

`constexpr` All The Things.

Load the `strong-type` skill (`.agents/skills/strong-type/SKILL.md`) when adding or changing
rollbear strong types. It records the pinned library API and migrated domain conventions.

Use Immer containers (often `immer::array`) for all containers passed as arguments, returned from
functions, or stored in objects, so copies share immutable data cheaply. Standard containers may be
used as function-local implementation details when they make the implementation cleaner or more
performant. Prefer constructing Immer containers directly, including through transients where
appropriate, rather than staging data in a standard container and copying it to Immer merely to
satisfy this rule. Choose local construction strategies based on performance.

Prefer function and class template argument deduction when arguments determine the types. Keep
explicit arguments or deduction guides when needed to preserve exact cv/ref qualification.

For simple stored IO actions, use free functions and `std::bind_front` to bind owned values or
explicit reference wrappers. When an action needs a struct, use a deducing-this call operator,
forwarding members with `FW`, rather than a mutable lambda. Balance `macros_push.hpp` and
`macros_pop.hpp` in every file using `FW`.

## Commits

Commits follow the Conventional Commit standard, as enforced by `gitlint`.

Prefer autosquash-style commits - `fixup!`/`squash!`/`amend!` - a clean git history is a goal of
project. Rewriting history is encouraged. However, do not attempt to rebase unless instructed – the
user will do that.

## Documentation

README should be left unmodified unless explicitly instructed.
